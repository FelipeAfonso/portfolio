    description: `At my bachelor's course I learned the fundamentals of computer science. Through it I was always looking for extra curricular activities and personal projects to pursue. Following are the highlights of my accomplishments:
     - Final Project: An Web E-Commerce with a Windows Point of Sale - The reason behind it was to reduce stock problems with a shared DB, while mantaining a native Windows application for the PoS. It was made with .NET with Entity Framework for the back-end; Razor for the web front end; and XAML for the windows front end;
     - Scholarship Project: Inverse Augmented Reality POC - I made an XAML Windows App that would enable drawing and controling a set of images to be used in a projector and overlayed with real products in order to highlight them. And to integrate with that, I've made an android app that would toggle those images using web sockets based on the shopping cart he was buying;
     - Personal Project: Along my Web Development Monitoring Scholarship I created a web platform for scheduling monitoring sessions for the students. It was made with .NET Razor and Entity Framework. It ended up being used by our campus for 2 years;
     - Scholarship Project: Mobile App for a 4.0 Industry POC - A Xamarin App for Android and Windows Phone for controlling a machine created by Mechanical Engineering Students using bluetooth.`,
